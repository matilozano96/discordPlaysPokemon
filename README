Version 1.0

Stable, usable.

Requisites:
- Python3
- mysqlite for python
- discord for python

How to use:
- Setup a Discord bot to be able to read and delete messages within a server
- In bot.py, replace the token field with your bot's token.

- Initialize EmuHawk
- Open Tools/Lua Console
- Script/Open Script -> DB.lua
- Run start.bat ( which runs bot.py )

- As of right now, the bot is able to read a, b, u, d, l, r, up, down, left, right, start, select, lt, rt; it's not case sensitive
- The bot will delete valid commands as they are read, just keep the chat clear of clutter

Pending changes / Issues
- Abstract Token to a config file, plus other variables
- Abstract input management to its own interface for more versatility
- Switch to a json format, if possible. Sql feels like overkill, possibly too slow
- Implement multi button inputs such as l+b to run
- Implement length of press depending on context ( such as longer presses for overworld steps, shorter ones for menu navigation, etc. )
